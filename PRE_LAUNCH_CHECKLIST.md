2. Verify database credentials in db_connect.php
3. Check MySQL user has proper permissions
4. Enable error logging in PHP configuration

### If database won't connect:
1. Verify credentials match Hostinger settings
2. Check that MySQL user is assigned to the database
3. Test credentials via phpMyAdmin in cPanel
4. Ensure database server is running

### If admin login fails:
1. Verify admin user exists: SELECT * FROM ipark_admins;
2. Check password_hash is working properly
3. Verify session support is enabled
4. Check for cookie/session conflicts
